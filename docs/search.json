    "text": "Quality Measurement and Monitoring in the Complex Patient\nI have published a substantial body of work dating back to the mid-1990s related to the use and misuse of hospital mortality rates. My contribution has been to show how measurement error can lead to significant misclassification when using mortality rates as hospital performance measures (Hofer 1996) and in using physician peer assessment to measure causal mechanisms, such as estimating the number of hospital deaths due to medical errors (Hayward 2001). Along with Hayward 2007, these latter two studies are among several I have published that show that the measurement attributing death to poor quality care in the often-quoted estimates of the large number of people dying from medical errors in US hospitals is so imprecise that the estimates of deaths attributable to errors are likely to be dramatically overstated.\nI continue to publish on the methodological issues in using mortality rates as performance measures in work that now spans over 15 years (Mohammed 2012) and have a related body of work that generalizes the identification of these methodological challenges and potential solutions to other outcomes used for performance measurement. This work illustrates the need to use appropriate analytic methods to measure important health outcomes in order to draw correct conclusions about more intangible concepts such as death attributable to medical error, and ultimately the appropriate quality improvement responses. Our cumulative contributions in this area have been influential in increasing the use by large organizations, such as CMS and the VA, of multilevel models for operational systems that use mortality rates for performance measurement.\nRelated publications: Hofer 1996 · Hayward 2001 · Hayward 2007 · Girling 2012 · Mohammed 2012"

I serve as a co-Investigator and design and analytic lead on several NCI and ACS-funded grants, including:\n\nA NCI-funded registry-based study of patterns of use of targeted therapies in metastatic cancers in diverse populations\nA NCI-funded randomized trial to improve patient-centered communication in breast cancer decision-making around treatment\nA population-based randomized trial of a virtual solution to reduce gaps in genetic risk evaluation and management in families at high risk for hereditary cancer syndromes\nA large ACS grant focusing on gaps in genetic risk prevention in breast cancer patients and their families\n\nOur CANSORT research group negotiated a novel collaboration between all of the major private genetic testing companies with NCI and IMS (NCI’s honest broker) to link all genetic testing results to the SEER registries. We developed and piloted this as part of the Georgia–California SEER Genetic Testing Linkage Initiative (GeneLINK). Previously I served as the Director of the measurement and methodology core for a Program award grant (P01) from NCI focusing on the Challenge of Individualizing Treatments for patients with breast cancer.

    "text": "Physician Implicit Review in Measuring Quality of Care\nAn additional contribution has been my work on the methodology and potential role of physician implicit review in quality measurement. Implicit review has fallen from favor in recent times given perceptions that it is expensive and subjective, as well as hopes of using big data to do all performance measurement on the cheap. However, implicit review was one of the principal methods used in every foundational study about quality of care in the US healthcare system and was the method on which all of the findings of the IOM report about deaths in hospitals due to medical errors was based.\nWhile my work has shown some of the problems in implicit review (Hofer 2000, Lilford 2007, Hayward 2001), it has also illustrated the analytic methods that can address some of those problems and the potential role for implicit review in quality measurement (Hofer 2004, Manseki-Holland 2017). In Hofer 2004, we assessed the degree of measurement error in quality assessments using analytic approaches essential for distinguishing true quality (signal) versus measurement error (noise). We described the magnitude of signal versus noise in quality measurements and how they varied across conditions with a highly developed evidence base (diabetes and heart disease) versus conditions with a smaller evidence base (COPD and acute short-course illnesses). Most recently, I have been involved in this method’s use to evaluate major shifts in staffing in the NHS (Bion 2021), and have advised NHS England about their plans to use it to search for preventable mortality in British hospitals.\nRelated publications: Hofer 2000 · Hayward 2001 · Hofer 2004 · Lilford 2007 · Manseki-Holland 2019 · Bion 2021"

    "text": "Multilevel Organizational Structures\nMuch of my work has focused on how to measure health care quality and utilization in the multilevel organizational structures typical of our delivery system, where physicians take care of panels of patients and are themselves clustered within hospitals or clinics. In a widely cited JAMA paper on physician profiling, we illustrated how provider reports can overstate the variability in provider practice and the ability to distinguish meaningfully between providers (Hofer 1999). The study was widely reported in the media, including the Associated Press, USA Today, NPR, and the CBC, and is part of a body of work that emphasizes the need to identify the organizational level at which variation occurs — both to assess the ability of performance monitoring systems to distinguish between providers and the best targets for interventions to remove unwanted variability.\nIn a more applied vein, I was a senior member of a group that developed and validated an automated APACHE-like measure and mortality monitoring system that extracts data elements from the clinical electronic databases that make up the VA electronic medical record (Render 2005). Based on this work, the VA established the InPatient Evaluation Center (IPEC), and the approach we developed is presently being applied in every ICU patient in the VA system — including over 160 ICUs and well over 100,000 discharges per year. Some of my more recent work has focused on variability of utilization of the ICU (Chen 2012, 2013).\nRelated publications: Hofer 1999 · Render 2005 · Chen 2012 · Chen 2013"

    "text": "Quality Improvement in Care for Diabetes and Other Common Chronic Diseases\nWhile several of my other contributions find significant flaws with popular existing ways of measuring health care quality, I have also worked on the development of better performance indicators, especially for chronic diseases like diabetes. We have published extensively on better ways to use clinical evidence to develop performance metrics in areas such as diabetic retinopathy screening (Vijan 2000) as well as better ways for clinical trials to report results so that performance measures can be optimally designed (Hayward 2005).\nIn one case, we explored the 2003 finding by a RAND group that less than half of recommended processes of care are actually provided to patients. We investigated the hypothesis that there is simply too much to do and that providers are not prioritizing in an optimal way when faced during a visit with acute problems and other competing demands. We found that although several high-priority aspects of diabetes care were clearly identified, physicians often prioritized care in a way clearly inconsistent with the epidemiological literature. Practicing physicians substantially underrated recommendations for care processes based upon more recent evidence. Furthermore, some areas stressed in performance measurement systems like HEDIS were overrated relative to their impact on outcomes as supported by the clinical trial and epidemiological literature.\nIn our most recent work in this line, we are focusing on the extent that existing measures have incentivized care that has as much over-treatment as under-treatment and how performance measures can be redesigned to ameliorate this problem (Kerr 2012, Sussman 2015), as well as tracking management and control during the COVID-19 pandemic (Aubert 2022).\nRelated publications: Vijan 2000 · Hayward 2005 · Hofer 2004 · Kerr 2012 · Sussman 2015 · Aubert 2022"
